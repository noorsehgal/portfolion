            <p class= "Life">
            My name is Noor Sehgal and I'm a second year interaction design student at PES University. Before pursuing design, I was a Humanities student at Apeejjay school, Noida. My hobbies include painting, sketching, reading novels and watching documentaries on netflix. I love animals a lot and I feed stray dogs in my locality regularly. I have a pet dog as well, his name is Amigo. <br>
            <br> I'm passionate about improving the lives of others through design and I am constantly looking to learn new things everyday. Currently I'm part of the Design Team of Bliss, which is a project initiated by the founders of Cubical Laboratories.
